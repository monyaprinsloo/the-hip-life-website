            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I’m a Cape Town-based 4th-year medical student by day and a wannabe runner by… well, whenever I can fit it in between studying and life.<p>

            </p> With a passion for holistic health, I strive to balance the mental, physical, and emotional chaos of life — think of it as my personal triathlon, but with fewer medals and more snacks.

                On a more serious note, I’m all about raising awareness for hip-related issues (because having a hip that’s not actually hip is surprisingly common). My journey through surgeries and recovery inspired me to share my experiences and promote well-being in every aspect—mind, body, and soul.</p>

        <div class="section" id="about-account">
            <h2>About @the.hip.life</h2>
            <p> What started as a tiny Instagram account with just a handful of followers, quickly turned into something special. I began by documenting my recovery after my first surgeries—partly to process my own journey, and partly because I would’ve loved to know what to expect. <p>
            <h3> Fast forward a bit, and now @the.hip.life is home to a vibrant, diverse group of wonderful people affectionately known as "hippys."</h3>
            <p> It’s become a safe space where we laugh, learn, and occasionally whine about physiotherapy together. I genuinely love interacting with this incredible community—it’s like having an extended family, but with fewer awkward reunions and more support.</p>

            <h2>My hope for "hippys"</h2>
            <p><strong>Vision:</strong> To build a supportive, fun, and empowering community where hip issues are less of a burden and more of a shared experience that connects people across the world.</p>
            <p><strong>Mission:</strong> To provide honest, relatable content about hip surgeries and recovery, foster positivity in the face of challenges, and spread a little humor—because laughter might not be the best medicine, but it’s definitely cheaper than therapy.</p>
